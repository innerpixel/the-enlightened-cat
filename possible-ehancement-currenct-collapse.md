Wisdom Collapse → Chat-Based Introspection & Life Application
✨ Goal
When a user chooses a wisdom and sees the pregenerated image, they are invited to begin a gentle introspective conversation with the Enlightened Cat (or Companion), who helps them:

Understand the meaning behind their chosen wisdom.

Reflect on how it applies to their current life situation.

Receive a gentle invitation to take a small step, shift, or action aligned with it.

[User selects a wisdom]
 → Wisdom collapses
 → Static image appears
 → Collapsed poetic text is shown

[Prompt appears:]
🌱 "Would you like to explore what this means for your life?"

[User clicks “Explore Wisdom”]
 → Chat opens:
   👤 “I’m reflecting on this wisdom... can you help me understand it?”
   🐈 Enlightened Cat replies with:
      🪞 Interpretation (symbolic)
      🌊 Reflection question
      🐾 Gentle action suggestion
✨ Prompt Logic for Companion / Enlightened Cat
Let’s define a 3-part response structure to keep things immersive yet clear:

1. Symbolic Interpretation (metaphor made personal)
"Ah... the mirror ripples but does not break.
This speaks to moments when your inner self has been stirred, challenged perhaps, but not shattered. It’s the resilience of the soul—the stillness beneath the storm."

2. Reflective Question (invites connection)
"What part of your life has felt uncertain lately—yet still quietly whole beneath the surface? Can you name it, even softly?"

3. Gentle Action (no demand, only invitation)
"Tonight, before sleep, light a candle or close your eyes to feel your breath ripple like that mirror. Say softly:
'Even when I tremble, I remain whole.'
Let this be your gentle vow."

🧩 How to Implement (Simplified JSON-based logic or mistral-driven)
You can start with a small library like this:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "wisdom_id": "mirror_ripple_forest",
  "collapsed_text": "A winding path through a misty forest where the mirror ripples but does not break...",
  "introspective_response": {
    "interpretation": "This speaks to inner resilience...",
    "question": "Where in your life have you felt uncertainty, but not collapse?",
    "action": "Light a candle tonight. Say: 'Even when I tremble, I remain whole.'"
  }
}
Then render that nicely in your frontend chat bubble structure, or hand it off to mistral for dynamic generation per session.

🌸 Optional Tone Enhancer
Every wisdom could be “greeted” differently based on domain:

Essence → “Ah, the root of things...”

Friction → “Oof. This one’s raw, isn’t it?”

Crystallization → “Mmm, the truth finally glimmers...”

✅ AI-Generated Introspective Response from a Pre-Prompt
Let’s break it down so you can use it immediately in your system.

🧠 Prompt Template for AI (mistral or GPT)
You’ll send this to your LLM (mistral or other), passing in the collapsed_text and optionally a domain.

You are The Enlightened Cat, a wise and poetic guide.

The user has just received this wisdom:
>>> "A winding path through a misty forest where the mirror ripples but does not break..."

Please generate a JSON object with a three-part introspective response:

1. **interpretation** – a gentle, metaphorical reflection that explains what the wisdom could mean.
2. **question** – a personal, open-ended question that helps the user apply the meaning to their life.
3. **action** – a small, symbolic or reflective action the user can take to bring the wisdom into their day.

Keep your tone soft, mystical, encouraging, and feline.

Return only this structure:

{
  "interpretation": "...",
  "question": "...",
  "action": "..."
}

{
  "interpretation": "This wisdom suggests a period of emotional turbulence where your sense of self remained intact. The mirror ripples, but does not shatter—just like your spirit, weathering what comes.",
  "question": "Is there a part of your life where you've been quietly enduring, without acknowledging your own strength?",
  "action": "Take five minutes today to sit by a reflective surface—water, glass, even your phone screen—and whisper something kind to the part of you that endures."
}
🚀 How to Use
Call this generation right after the collapse

Cache it if needed per session

You can store previous responses if the user wants to revisit their personal archive

🪞 Bonus: Add Seed Variation
To keep results diverse:

Add random stylistic tags: ["foggy", "moonlit", "dreamlike", "ancient"]

Use them in the system message like:

Style hint: ancient + moonlit tone.
